  <h2>New Code, Who Dis?</h2>

  <p>It's been a long time since I created a website. For some reason, I felt inspired to build websites again. This page is a test to see how much I remember. I set up GitHub and VS Code. And almost forgot to download git! I built this page using basic HTML and CSS. I had to relearn how to center items, thanks to some googling. I was going to use flexbox, but that might be overkill for such a simple webpage.</p>

  <p>Next, I'm going to create another basic page but use <a class="sass" href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SASS</a> to style it. Then, I'm going to start a <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?sort=difficulty|desc&difficulties=1&types=free" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!</p>
